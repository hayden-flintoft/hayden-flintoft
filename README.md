# 👋 Hi, I'm Hayden
I’m a passionate Full Stack Web Developer based in Nelson, New Zealand, with over four years of hands-on training in creating dynamic, user-friendly web solutions. I love using React, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, and PHP to build intuitive and efficient web applications.

## 🌟 About Me
I recently completed a 17-week intensive boot camp at Dev Academy, where I honed my skills in modern web technologies and agile methodologies. I'm driven by the excitement of solving problems and turning creative ideas into real-world solutions.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me tutoring kids at CoderDojo Nelson, where I teach Python and Scratch, sharing my love for coding with the next generation of developers. I’m also a gaming enthusiast with a long-term dream of developing my own games!

## 🌍 Projects
Tic-Stack-Token
A strategic twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, Tic-Stack-Token adds a new layer of strategy by allowing players to stack tokens on top of others with lower numbers. Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Material-UI, this project showcases my passion for game development and ongoing commitment to enhancing the player experience.

Let 'Em Cook
Let 'Em Cook is a recipe discovery platform I developed with a talented team. It helps users find creative recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. With a focus on reducing food waste, we built this app using React, Tailwind CSS, Express, and The MealDB API. This project is a testament to my collaborative skills and ability to build full-stack applications under tight deadlines.
